# Web API

This project is a basic REST API with the basic functionality of any REST client. It includes the GET and POST methods and has the following endpoints:

- "/"
- "/user"
- "/create"
- "/api"

The root endpoint prints a Hello World HTTP Response object. The "/user" endpoint creates a user and returns it. The "/create" endpoint manages a post request. The "/api" endpoint prints a welcome message and uses middleware for a simulated authentication.

## How to use it
Move to the project folder and run the project on the terminal with the command: `go run .` and it will turn on the server in the 3000 port.
